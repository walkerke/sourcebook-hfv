Documentation:

<https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/industry-titles.htm>

> *The QCEW program uses the [North American Industry Classification System](https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/home.htm) (NAICS) as to assign establishments to industries and to report industry data at highly detailed as well as at aggregated levels.*

## High-Level Industry Titles and NAICS Crosswalk

Documentation:

<https://www.bls.gov/cew/classifications/industry/high-level-industries.htm>

> *The highest levels of aggregation in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) are NAICS Sectors. The QCEW aggregates data to three higher levels in order to provide comparability to other programs that have less detailed data. These levels are the SuperSector level, the twelve of which represent combinations of from one to four NAICS Sectors, the Domain level. Two of which represent combinations of three and nine Supersectors, the overall all industry total. While these aggregates do not have official NAICS codes, the QCEW program assigns them codes to provide ready reference. The codes and their corresponding titles are shown in the QCEW High-Level Industry Titles table below. The NAICS codes that make up each SuperSector are shown in the second table below titled QCEW High-Level Industry Crosswalk Table.*

> *QCEW has created a full-industry crosswalk for all versions of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), with the most recent version (NAICS 2022) included in the table below, along with High-Level BLS industries. This is a tool created to help data users quickly reference industry relationships while using QCEW database options. QCEW is also providing a downloadable option of this table for data users, along with additional historical crosswalks for previous versions of NAICS.*
